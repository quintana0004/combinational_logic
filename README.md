# combinational_logic
This is a combinational logic implemented with Verilog using Vivado, this is a challenge from a course of EDX called Introduction to hardware Design by the University of Galileo. 

The Reto.v is where thw code is created with the following combinational logic:

As for the testbench created is the Reto_tb.v, the following testbench gave the following simulation in Vivado:

The challenge was to dictate which of the outputs will be high, the value 3 and 6 is when the output is high.
